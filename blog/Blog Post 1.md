# Welcome Message

I have a couple of ideas for this blog. Naturally, they all have to do with the craft of writing.

I picture it as a record of my progress in learning the craft. I want to use it to store helpful tidbits and keep myself aware of some basic things that I tend to forget from day to day.

I keep an index card folded lengthwise in my front left pocket. One the card is a numbered list of statements that are meant to quell any hesitations I have about plowing onward toward the infinite horizon of good writing. 

In fact, that's one of them. Number 3: The horizon of good writing is infinite. This is a quote attributed to [David Foster Wallace][dfw], an author whose talent often seems infinitely far away from wherever it is I'm standing. When I read this one, several things come to mind:

  - **There is not and will never be a World's Best Writer Championship**. I have a competitive spirit. This means that I'm driven and prone to seriousness, but if I take myself too seriously, it easily starts hindering my writing, my interest in writing, and my ideas.
  - **I can always get better, and as long as I keep going, I will get better**. I think it was Ira Glass who said that our tastes as artists are the reason our work disappoints us. If I keep reading and writing, then theoretically they will both improve. So even if I could match the pace of my tastes, I would never be able to overtake them.
  - **If I truly believe that the horizon of good writing is infinite, then I have to keep going to honour its perpetuity.** On this infinite plane of creativity, there is a place for me at every stage. There's a place for everyone else, too. We are each trapped in our minds and somewhat limited by our experiences. But that's one of the best reasons to read--to get a sense of another perspective. And so I humbly offer my own  perspective which lies on the good writing plane at different places for everyone who reads it.

It's probably impossible to make any kind of art without comparing your work to everyone else's. This seems to be as healthy as it is unhealthy. You can't stand on the shoulders of giants unless you understand what makes them great. But if you constantly compare your work to other people's work, you might never go off in the direction that ultimately makes you join the ranks of giants.
